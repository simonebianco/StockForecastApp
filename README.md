# StockForecastApp

### INFO

This application created and shared with Streamlit using Python allows you to run time series forecasts of stock market securities taken from Yahoo Finance using the Facebook Prophet module. A data time horizon of six years is considered for the forecast calculation with the possibility of generating the forecast for 1-5 years thereafter. Descriptive statistics of the dataset, ADF Test for stationarity and Hurst Exponent Test for long-term memory as well as a comparison tool between predicted and actual values are displayed.
